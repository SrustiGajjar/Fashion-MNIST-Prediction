# Fashion-MNIST-Prediction
#### We have to consider popular Fashion MNIST dataset for this project. The dataset includes tiny images of fashion pieces. The objective is to create a set of supervised learning models that can predict the type of item based on its image. And use the same models to predict the new test images and revert with the correct lable for the image.
